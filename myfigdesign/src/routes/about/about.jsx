            My main work was focused in the logistics industry, warehouses and
            trucks were my bread and butter, and I did that for 17 years.

            Other ventures I have had include running my own house
            rehabilitation company (AS).

            I worked as a promoter for a virtual reality corporation where my
            job description would be rigging up equipment at different promotion
            sites such as schools, universities, and GamesCon. I also did some
            work on branding for the company.

            After finishing my education in child and youth work, I worked as a
            teacher assistant at a pre-school for a year.

            I worked at a youth center in Stavanger where we taught kids how to
            video edit, make music using Nuendo, and rig up equipment for small
            to medium concerts. We also had photography classes with our own
            darkroom where we produced the pictures we had taken.
